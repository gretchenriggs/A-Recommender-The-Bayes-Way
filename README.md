## A Series of Fortuanate Fraud Detection
We modeled a Fraud Detection Classifier that could detect fraudulent activity for an Event Ticket Sales company.

The project involved cleaning a highly noisy dataset, using NLP to create feature based on language content in ticket sale emails, feature selection, building multiple models to attain premium output results (Random Forest, AdaBoost, Neural Network, & Logistic Regression), and creating a web page, displaying our results, with a built in application to predict Fraud/Not Fraud on new data points.
